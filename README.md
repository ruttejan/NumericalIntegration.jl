# NumericalIntegration [![Build Status](https://github.com/ruttejan/NumericalIntegration.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ruttejan/NumericalIntegration.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

This project aims to implement basic methods of Numerical integration: Midpoint, Trapezoid, Simpson.

## Instalation

The package is not registered and this can be installed in the following way

```julie
(@v1.7) add https://github.com/ruttejan/Projekt_ruttejan
```

## Info and usage

Implemented methods can be used for calculating definite integral, error upper bound and visualization.

Usage of these methods is demonstrated [[here](https://ruttejan.github.io/NumIntegration/)].

Note: There is a small difference between the implementation of the numerical_int() method in the presentation and the actual source code. The presentation is designed for teaching purposes, and as a result, the code was simplified for better understanding.
